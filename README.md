# To-Do-List-JavaScript-with-Bootstrap

This is a To Do List Application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap

Functionality:
  1. It takes an INPUT as a TASK and lists it down to your To Do List
  2. It has a function to cross out a task when you click the task. I used a eventlistener with textDecoration as 'line-through'
  3. It has a function of deleting a task by double-clicking the task
